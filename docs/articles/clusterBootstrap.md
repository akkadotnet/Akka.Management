# Cluster Bootstrap
Akka Cluster Bootstrap helps forming (or joining to) a cluster by using Akka Discovery to discover peer nodes.
It is an alternative to configuring static seed-nodes in dynamic deployment environments such as on Kubernetes or AWS.

It builds on the flexibility of Akka Discovery, leveraging a range of discovery mechanisms depending on the environment you
want to run your cluster in.

Cluster bootstrap depends on:
- Akka.Discovery to discover other members of the cluster
- Akka.Management to host HTTP endpoints used during the bootstrap process

## Usage
Akka management must be started as well as the bootstrap process, this can either be done through config or programmatically.

### Setting Up Cluster.Bootstrap from HOCON Configuration

Listing the ClusterBootstrap extension among the autoloaded akka.extensions in your configuration will cause it to autostart:

```
# trigger autostart by loading the extension through config
akka.extensions = ["Akka.Management.Cluster.Bootstrap.ClusterBootstrapProvider, Akka.Management.Cluster.Bootstrap"]
```

If management or bootstrap configuration is incorrect, the autostart will log an error and terminate the actor system.

### Setting Up Cluster.Bootstrap Programmatically
```
// Akka Management hosts the HTTP routes used by bootstrap
await AkkaManagement.Get(system).Start();

// Starting the bootstrap process needs to be done explicitly
await ClusterBootstrap.Get(system).Start();
```

Ensure that `seed-nodes` is not present in configuration and that either autoloading through config or start() is called on every node.

The following configuration is required, more details for each and additional configuration can be found in the reference configuration:

- `akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.contact-point-discovery.service-name`: a unique name in the deployment environment for this
  cluster instance which is used to lookup peers in service discovery. If unset, it will be derived from the ActorSystem name.
- `akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.contact-point-discovery.discovery-method`: the intended service discovery mechanism
  (from what choices [Akka Discovery](https://getakka.net/articles/discovery/index.html) provides). If unset, falls back to the system-wide default from akka.discovery.method.

### Exposed Akka.Management REST API Endpoint
`Akka.Management.Cluster.Bootstrap` will add a new REST HTTP API endpoint to the `Akka.Management` HTTP
server at the address `http://{host}:{port}/bootstrap/seed-nodes`. Calling a GET on this endpoint will
return a JSON document containing the Akka cluster address of the node and a list of up to 5 seed nodes
from the that Akka node.

## How It Works

- Each node exposes an HTTP endpoint `/bootstrap/seed-nodes`. This is provided by Akka.Management.Cluster.Bootstrap and
  exposed automatically by starting Akka.Management.
- `/bootstrap/seed-nodes` will query its internal cluster state and returns a list of members that are either in the up, weakly up,
  or joining state
- During bootstrap each node queries service discovery repeatedly to get the initial contact points until at least the number
  of contact points (and recommended exactly equal) as defined in contact-point-discovery.required-contact-point-nr has been found.
- Each node then probes these found contact points `/bootstrap/seed-nodes` endpoint to see if a cluster has already been formed
    - If there is an existing cluster, it joins the cluster and bootstrapping is finished.
    - If no cluster exists and every node returns an empty list of seed-nodes, The node with the lowest address from the set of
      contact points forms a new cluster.
    - Other nodes will start to see the `/bootstrap/seed-nodes` of the node that self-joined and will join its cluster.

Please see the [complete bootstrap process documentation](./BOOTSTRAP_PROCESS.md) for more information.

## Joining Mechanism Precedence
As Akka Cluster allows nodes to join to a cluster using multiple different methods, the precedence of each method is strictly defined and is as follows:

- If akka.cluster.seed-nodes (in your HOCON configuration) are non-empty, those nodes will be joined,
  and bootstrap will NOT execute even if start() is called or autostart through configuration is enabled,
  however a warning will be logged.
- If an explicit Cluster.Join or Cluster.JoinSeedNodes is invoked before the bootstrap completes,
  that joining would take precedence over the bootstrap (but itâ€™s not recommended to do so, see below).
- The Cluster Bootstrap mechanism takes some time to complete, but eventually issues a joinSeednodes.

> [!WARNING]
> It is __NOT__ recommended to mix various joining mechanisms. Pick one mechanism and stick to it in order to avoid any surprises
> during cluster formation. E.g. do __NOT__ set akka.cluster.seed-nodes and do __NOT__ call Cluster.Join if you are going to be
> using the Bootstrap mechanism.

## Deployment Considerations
### Initial deployment
Cluster Bootstrap will always attempt to join an existing cluster if possible. However if no other contact point advertises
any `seed-nodes`, a new cluster will be formed by the node decided by the `JoinDecider` where the default sorts the addresses
then picks the lowest.

The HOCON setting `akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.new-cluster-enabled` can be used to disable new cluster formation and
to only allow the node to join existing clusters.


- On initial deployment use the default akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.new-cluster-enabled=on
- Following the initial deployment it is recommended to set `akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.new-cluster-enabled=off` with an
  immediate re-deployment once the initial cluster has formed

This can be used to provide additional safety during restarts and redeploys while there is a network partition present.
Without new cluster formation disabled, an isolated set of nodes could form a new cluster, creating a split-brain.

### Recommended Configuration
When using the bootstrap module, there are some underlying Akka Cluster settings that should be specified to ensure that
your deployment is robust.

Since the target environments for this module are dynamic, that is, instances can come and go, failure needs to be considered.
The following configuration will result in your application being shut down after 30 seconds if it is unable to join the
discovered seed nodes. In this case, the orchestrator (i.e. Kubernetes or Marathon) will restart your node and the operation will
(presumably) eventually succeed. You will want to specify the following in your HOCON configuration:

```
akka.cluster.shutdown-after-unsuccessful-join-seed-nodes = 30s
```

### Rolling Updates
#### Graceful Shutdown
Akka Cluster can handle hard failures using a downing provider such as the split brain resolver discussed below.
However this should not be relied upon for regular rolling redeploys. Features such as ClusterSingletons and ClusterSharding
can safely restart actors on new nodes far quicker when it is certain that a node has shutdown rather than crashed.

Graceful leaving will happen with the default settings as it is part of Coordinated Shutdown.
Just ensure that a node is sent a SIGTERM and not a SIGKILL. Environments such as Kubernetes will do this,
it is important to ensure that if the CLR is wrapped with a script that it forwards the signal.

Upon receiving a SIGTERM Coordinated Shutdown will:

- Perform a Cluster.Get(system).Leave() on itself
- The status of the member will be changed to Exiting while allowing any shards to be shutdown gracefully
  and ClusterSingletons to be migrated if this was the oldest node. Finally the node is removed from the Akka Cluster membership.

#### Number of Nodes to Redeploy At Once
Akka bootstrap requires a `stable-period` where service discovery returns a stable set of contact points.
When doing rolling updates, it is best to wait for a node (or group of nodes) to finish joining the cluster before adding
and removing other nodes.

#### Cluster Singleton
`ClusterSingleton`s run on the oldest node in the cluster. To avoid singletons moving during every node deployment,
it is advised to start a rolling redeploy starting at the newest node. Then ClusterSingletons only move once.
This is the default behaviour for Kubernetes deployments. Cluster Sharding uses a singleton internally so this is important,
even if not using singletons directly.

### Split Brains and Ungraceful Shutdown
Nodes can crash causing cluster members to become unreachable. This is a tricky problem as it is not possible to distinguish
between a network partition and a node failure. To rectify this in an automated manner, make sure you enable the
Split Brain Resolver. This module has a number of strategies that can ensure that the cluster continues to function
during network partitions and node failures.
