#### Summary

* `build.[cmd|sh] all` - runs the entire build system minus documentation: `NBench`, `Tests`, and `Nuget`.
* `build.[cmd|sh] buildrelease` - compiles the solution in `Release` mode.
* `build.[cmd|sh] tests` - compiles the solution in `Release` mode and runs the unit test suite (all projects that end with the `.Tests.csproj` suffix). All of the output will be published to the `./TestResults` folder.
* `build.[cmd|sh] nbench` - compiles the solution in `Release` mode and runs the [NBench](https://nbench.io/) performance test suite (all projects that end with the `.Tests.Performance.csproj` suffix). All of the output will be published to the `./PerfResults` folder.
* `build.[cmd|sh] nuget` - compiles the solution in `Release` mode and creates Nuget packages from any project that does not have `<IsPackable>false</IsPackable>` set and uses the version number from `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
* `build.[cmd|sh] nuget nugetprerelease=dev` - compiles the solution in `Release` mode and creates Nuget packages from any project that does not have `<IsPackable>false</IsPackable>` set - but in this instance all projects will have a `VersionSuffix` of `-beta{DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks}`. It's typically used for publishing nightly releases.
* `build.[cmd|sh] nuget SignClientUser=$(signingUsername) SignClientSecret=$(signingPassword)` - compiles the solution in `Release` modem creates Nuget packages from any project that does not have `<IsPackable>false</IsPackable>` set using the version number from `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and then signs those packages using the SignClient data below.
* `build.[cmd|sh] nuget SignClientUser=$(signingUsername) SignClientSecret=$(signingPassword) nugetpublishurl=$(nugetUrl) nugetkey=$(nugetKey)` - compiles the solution in `Release` modem creates Nuget packages from any project that does not have `<IsPackable>false</IsPackable>` set using the version number from `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, signs those packages using the SignClient data below, and then publishes those packages to the `$(nugetUrl)` using NuGet key `$(nugetKey)`.
* `build.[cmd|sh] DocFx` - compiles the solution in `Release` mode and then uses [DocFx](http://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) to generate website documentation inside the `./docs/_site` folder. Use the `./serve-docs.cmd` on Windows to preview the documentation.
