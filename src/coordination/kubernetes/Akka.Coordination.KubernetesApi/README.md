# Kubernetes Lease
This module is an implementation of an Akka Coordination Lease backed by a [Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in Kubernetes. Resources in Kubernetes offer concurrency control and consistency that have been used to build a distributed lease/lock.

A lease can be used for:

* [Split Brain Resolver](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/split-brain-resolver.html). An additional safety measure so that only one SBR instance can make the decision to remain up.
* [Cluster Singleton](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-singleton.html). A singleton manager can be configured to acquire a lease before creating the singleton.
* [Cluster Sharding](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html). Each Shard can be configured to acquire a lease before creating entity actors.

In all cases the use of the lease increases the consistency of the feature. However, as the Kubernetes API server and its backing `etcd` cluster can also be subject to failure and network issues any use of this lease can reduce availability.

## Lease Instances

* With Split Brain Resolver there will be one lease per Akka Cluster
* With multiple Akka Clusters using SBRs in the same namespace, you must ensure different `ActorSystem` names because they all need a separate lease.
* With Cluster Sharding and Cluster Singleton there will be more leases
    * For Cluster Singleton there will be one per singleton.
    * For Cluster Sharding, there will be one per shard per type.

## Configuring

### Creating the Custom Resource Definition for the lease

This requires admin privileges to your Kubernetes / Open Shift cluster but only needs doing once.

Kubernetes:
```
kubectl apply -f lease.yml
```

Where lease.yml contains:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  # name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form: <plural>.<group>
  name: leases.akka.io
spec:
  group: akka.io
  versions:
    - name: v1
      storage: true
      served: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                owner:
                  type: string
                version:
                  type: string
                time:
                  type: integer
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    # kind is normally the CamelCased singular type. Your resource manifests use this.
    kind: Lease
    listKind: LeaseList
    # singular name to be used as an alias on the CLI and for display
    singular: lease
    # plural name to be used in the URL: /apis/<group>/<version>/<plural>
    plural: leases
```

### Role based access control

Each pod needs permission to read/create and update lease resources. They only need access for the namespace they are in.

An example RBAC that can be used:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: lease-access
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["akka.io"]
    resources: ["leases"]
    verbs: ["get", "create", "update", "list"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: lease-access
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: system:serviceaccount:<YOUR NAMESPACE>:default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: lease-access
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

This defines a `Role` that is allows to `get`, `create` and `update` lease objects and a `RoleBinding` that gives the default service user this role in `<YOUR NAMESPACE>`.

Future versions may also require delete access for cleaning up old resources. Current uses within Akka only create a single lease so cleanup is not an issue.

To avoid giving an application the access to create new leases an empty lease can be created in the same namespace as the application with:

```shell
kubelctl create -f sbr-lease.yml -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
```

Where sbr-lease.yml contains:

```yaml
apiVersion: "akka.io/v1"
kind: Lease
metadata:
  name: <YOUR_ACTORSYSTEM_NAME>-akka-sbr
spec:
  owner: ""
  time: 0
```

> __NOTE__
> 
> The lease gets created only during an actual Split Brain.

### Enable In SBR Using Akka.Cluster.Hosting

To enable Kubernetes lease inside SBR, you need to pass a `LeaseMajorityOption` instance into the second parameter of the `WithClsutering()` extension method and specify that you're using the Kubernetes lease implementation.

```csharp
using var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
    {
        services.AddAkka("k8sLeaseDemo", (builder, provider) =>
        {
            builder
                .WithRemoting("", 4053)
                .WithClustering(sbrOption: new LeaseMajorityOption
                {
                    LeaseImplementation = "akka.coordination.lease.kubernetes",
                    LeaseName = "myActorSystem-akka-sbr"
                });
        });
    }).Build();

await host.RunAsync();
```

### Enable In SBR Using HOCON Configuration

To enable the lease for use within SBR:

```
akka.cluster {
    downing-provider-class = "Akka.Cluster.SBR.SplitBrainResolverProvider, Akka.Cluster"
    split-brain-resolver {
        active-strategy = lease-majority
        lease-majority {
            lease-implementation = "akka.coordination.lease.kubernetes"
        }
    }
}
```
